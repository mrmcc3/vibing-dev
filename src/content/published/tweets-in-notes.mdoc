Including tweets in notes and articles used to be as simple as importing the component in mdx.

```mdx
<Tweet id="1588546958615977985" />
```

**Update: Feb 4th, 2023**. Unfortunately twitter will cut off free access to their api. I definitely
don't care about sharing tweets on this site enough to pay for access. It's a bit of a shame to see
it become more of a walled garden.
