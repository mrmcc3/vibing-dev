import Tweet from "@site/Tweet.astro";
export const title = "MDX!";
// export const pubDate = "2022-11-06T03:45:32.509Z";

Thought about authoring purely in `astro` templates.
But there's just no substitute for markdown when it
comes to things like fenced code blocks.

But what about custom components with data loading...
You're left with MDX which is... complicated. But
I'm gonna try and make it work

```js
const msg = "look Ma, Syntax Highlighting";
```

<Tweet id="1342342342" />
