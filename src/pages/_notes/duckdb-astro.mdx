Here's an interesting architecture for a reporting site.

1. Incremental ETL script that updates a local [DuckDB][1] file
2. A static [Astro][2] site where templates can directly leverage DuckDB's rich analytical queries
3. The built site is published to Cloudflare Pages (or similar)

The steps above run on a schedule in github actions. The DB file is
cached and restored on every run (but can be rebuilt if lost).
