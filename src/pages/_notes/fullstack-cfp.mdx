A lot of the pieces were already in place to consider [Cloudflare Pages][3]
as a target for web projects. It's been a strong
choice for hosting static sites for a while now but the
announcements this [week][5] really up the game for full stack apps.

- Bindings to [D1][1] (open alpha)
- Secret Support
- Logs
- Upcoming support for [Queues][6] & [Workers Analytics Engine][7]

It feels like the right time for more ambitious projects and experiments on CFP.
