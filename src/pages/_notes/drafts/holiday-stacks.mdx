For better or for worse whenever the festive season rolls around I feel the
invigorating urge to learn something new. Usually it's a short-lived attempt
at [Advent of Code][aoc]. This year I'm going to build the same web project in a hand-full
of stacks that I find interesting.

Don't come at me with the whole put down the keyboard, go outside and relax...
I can't be saved. You're reading this so chances are you're on the same page.
Welcome.

## The Project

The vast majority of web projects I've worked on have

- a landing page
- a way to invite or sign up new users
- user identification via auth (login, logout, sessions)
- dashboard + navigation menu
- a user profile page
- user organization (likely with basic roles & permissions)

So let's do that. Similar to what [clerk.dev][clerk] provides.
To get a good understanding of the strengths (and weaknesses) of these
stacks, I want something more useful than a throw away demo.

## Introducing the stacks!

### 1. The Fresh Stack

The thing that excites me about this one is the absence of build tooling
and the consistent dev and prod environments. Seriously! have you tried writing
anything in deno? It's a **pleasure** to use. Hopefully that seeps into the whole stack?

- Hosting: [Deno Deploy][deno-deploy]
- Language: TypeScript
- Runtime: [Deno][deno]
- Web Framework: [Fresh][fresh]
- Client JS: [Preact][preact] and perhaps [htmx][htmx]?
- Styling: [Twind][twind]
- Database: [Supabase][supabase]

[deno]: https://deno.land/
[deno-deploy]: https://deno.com/deploy
[fresh]: https://fresh.deno.dev/
[preact]: https://preactjs.com/
[htmx]: https://htmx.org/
[twind]: https://twind.dev/
[planetscale]: https://planetscale.com/
[supabase]: https://supabase.com/

### 2. The Go Stack

Alright, this one is out of my comfort zone. I've never used [htmx] before but it's been
living in my head for months. I asked myself what non-js server stack would be
a great fit? [Go][go] templates and [Fly.io][fly] should be good right?
If we're on fly we may as well try out some shiny DB tech as well...
It's the season for it.

- Hosting: [Fly.io][fly]
- Language: [Go][go]
- Web Framework: [Fiber][fiber]
- Client JS: [htmx][htmx] + [Alpine.js][alpine]
- Styling: [Tailwind CSS][tailwind]
- Database: [SQLite + LiteFS][litefs]

[go]: https://go.dev/
[fiber]: https://gofiber.io/
[fly]: https://fly.io/
[alpine]: https://alpinejs.dev/
[tailwind]: https://tailwindcss.com/
[litefs]: https://fly.io/docs/litefs/

### 3. The Svelte Stack

I'll admit svelte always seemed a bit weird to me. Recently I used it for some animations
on an [Astro][astro] site with great success! Since then
I've been following the development of [SvelteKit][sk] from a far and it's hard not to
admire the work going on there. A **1.0** release is imminent so it makes sense to kick the
tyres. Excited to try out the per page rendering modes and first class support on vercel.

- Hosting: [Vercel][vercel]
- Language: JavaScript/TypeScript/Svelte
- Runtime: Hmm... Node.js in dev? [Vercel Edge Runtime][ver] in prod?
- Web Framework: [SvelteKit][sk]
- Client JS: [Svelte][svelte]
- Styling: [Tailwind CSS][tailwind]
- Database: [PlanetScale][planetscale]

[vercel]: https://vercel.com/
[ver]: https://edge-runtime.vercel.app/
[sk]: https://kit.svelte.dev/
[svelte]: https://svelte.dev/

### 4. The Astro Stack

I've really enjoyed building sites with [Astro][astro] lately. It's a really interesting mix of
pragmatism and new ideas. It's fairly obvious Astro is more focused on web sites then apps but
I'm curious how far it can go in SSR mode with something like [htmx][htmx]. This will also be my
first look at [Cloudflare D1][d1] which just hit open alpha.

- Hosting: [Cloudflare Pages][cfp]
- Language: JavaScript/TypeScript/Astro/Svelte
- Runtime: Node.js in dev. [Cloudflare Workers][cfw] in prod
- Web Framework: [Astro][astro]
- Client JS: [Svelte][svelte] + [htmx][htmx]
- Styling: [Tailwind CSS][tailwind]
- Database: [D1][d1]

[cfp]: https://pages.cloudflare.com/
[cfw]: https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/
[astro]: https://astro.build/
[d1]: https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/

### 5. The Phoenix Stack

I have so many questions about this stack that I don't know where to begin.
To be honest I'll be impressed if I get this far.

- Hosting: [Fly.io][fly]
- Language: [Elixir][elixir]
- Runtime: Beam (Erlang virtual machine)
- Web Framework: [Phoenix LiveView][phoenix]
- Client JS: LiveView + [Alpine.js][alpine]
- Styling: [Tailwind CSS][tailwind]
- Database: [PlanetScale][planetscale] or [Supabase][supabase]?

[phoenix]: https://www.phoenixframework.org/

So there it is 5 stacks, 4 hosting providers, 4 databases, 3 languages. Wish me luck.

What missed out. Qwik, Marko, Next.js 13, surely heaps of others. Maybe you've got a
stack in mind that's way better then these? You should absolutely tell me about it or
better yet, build it and **show** me the way.
