So if you've been building for the web lately no doubt you've heard about edge platforms.
Two popular offerings are [Cloudflare Workers][workers] and
[Deno Deploy][deno-deploy]. Which are used to power other edge
products from companies like [Vercel][vercel-edge] and [Netlify][netlify-edge].

These platforms will make copies of your code (javascript/webassembly) and distribute it all over
their global network.
When a request is made they'll execute it at the data center closest to the user.
Cloudflare and Deno are clearly betting on this model

- [The Future of the Web is on the Edge][fotw-edge] (Deno Deploy)
- [The Edge Computing Opportunity][edge-opp] (Cloudflare Workers)

But what does it mean for us developers when our code is running everywhere.

## Content sites don't apply

Consider static, content focused websites. You can build all the HTML and associated assets
ahead of time and publish to a CDN. Done! Your code runs at build time (locally or on a build server).

Alternatively if you're building sites with public,
dynamic content (perhaps a news site) it's often
acceptable to serve stale content for a small window of time.
In this case you could use caching (stale-while-revalidate)
or something like incremental static regeneration (ISR) to get the performance of edge, while still
generating HTML on an origin server.

In these scenarios there really is no need to run your own code on the edge.
Just let the CDNs handle it.

## Middleware, everywhere close to users

So when does it make sense to use the edge? Here are a few examples

- A/B testing
- Feature Flags
- Modify incoming requests
- Set security headers
- Hot-link protection
- CORS header proxy
- Rewrite links
- Bulk/dynamic redirects
- Perform bot protection
- Validation
- Rate Limiting
- Authentication & cookie parsing
- Collect logging, metrics, analytics
- Initiate and handle scheduled tasks (cron jobs)
- Localization
  - i18n
  - Country Code redirects
  - Make requests to local apis
  - Rewrite content based on location.

In all these examples you can think about your code on the edge as server middleware
that happens to run close to your users. It often makes sense to offload a whole range of tasks
to the edge (which is scalable and inexpensive).

While edge runtimes certainly have limitations (code size, cpu, memory, request lifecycle) they're
more than capable for most task. It begs the question, why stop at offloading a subset
of functionality from origin servers to the edge? Why not offload it all? Remove
the origin entirely!

## Move it all to the edge?

The ecosystem around javascript web frameworks definitely isn't standing still.
Next.js, Remix, SvelteKit, Solid, Qwik, Vue/Nuxt, Marko even HTMX & Astro they're all
pushing their own takes on what it means to build for the web.

Interestingly a lot of these projects are advertising first class support for
edge runtimes. From experience first class is a bit of a stretch
but they're definitely getting better. Focusing entirely on the framework & runtime there's
really nothing stopping us from building apps entirely on the edge.

So, Programs on the edge... Are we there yet?

Yep. Edge runtimes are already good enough and frameworks are catching up quickly and won't
be slowing down anytime soon. However,
there's an elephant in the room. The elephant is always there in any non trivial bit
of software... The **database**. The system of record
that manages all the information that you and your users derive value from when they use your
software.

Still here? Have a look at the [second article](information) in this series which explores the
challenges of dealing with information on the edge.
