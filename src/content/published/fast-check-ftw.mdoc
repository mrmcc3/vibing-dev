If you write any kind of data processing code in javascript and haven't heard of [Fast Check][fc] do
yourself a favour and go learn it. Even just sampling values by composing [arbitraries][arb] can
provide insight.

Quick-Check style libraries like this should be first-class in all language ecosystems. Put em
straight in std libs! it could only result in higher quality software.
