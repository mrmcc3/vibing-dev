[Cloudflare Pages][pages] has been a strong option for hosting static
sites for a while now but the announcements this [week][5] really
up the game for full stack apps.

- Bindings to [D1][d1] (open alpha)
- Secret Support
- Logs
- Upcoming support for [Queues][6] & [Workers Analytics Engine][7]

It feels like the right time for more ambitious projects and experiments on CFP.
