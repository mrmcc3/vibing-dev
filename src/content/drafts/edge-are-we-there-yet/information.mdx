An often heard criticism of deploying programs to the edge goes something like this:

> "Yeah but you have to go to the database anyway so any benefit of running
> at the edge disappears"

The argument is presented well in this video [Is _edge_ computing really faster](https://youtu.be/yOP5-3_WFus).
As an example say you're building a web app and decide to deploy to the edge. Perhaps with
SvelteKit, maybe it's Remix.

- A request comes in & you lookup a users session to validate it. That's one trip to the DB
- Now for a specific route you have to load some data or handle an action. That's another trip

Yes there's other approaches to sessions, and maybe you could find a way to jam all your data
requirements into a single request, but that's beside the point. If you have to make a request to
the other side of the world than there's essentially no benefit to constructing the user response
at the edge compared to an origin server near the data. The more requests to the database,
the slower the edge application is.

I guess that leads to recommendations like this [tweet](https://twitter.com/leeerob/status/1618005723421769735)

On one hand it's practical advice given the current tech landscape, on the other I think it's a
step in the entirely wrong direction. If you think about it that argument is essentially saying:
deploying applications to the edge is slow because of the non-edge stuff.

**"You (probably) don't want global data."**

That seems a bit presumptuous. Sure many systems
exhibit, or require a large degree of locality. The edge by definition seems like a bad fit here.
Yet plenty of applications serve users all over the globe. To quote [cloudflare](https://blog.cloudflare.com/early-hints-performance/)

> Cloudflare sits within 50 milliseconds of 95% of the Internet-connected population globally

Maybe I'm too optimistic, but that seems like a big opportunity to give the users what they
want! fast leverage over information wherever they may be.

**â€œEdge came off as replicating data to every region. Most of the time, that's probably not what you want for general transactional data."**

So because information enters in a transaction we're not allowed to move it close to users? ðŸ¤”
why is that?

**"You want regional compute, close to your data, with specialized data APIs for truly global data."**

What makes data truly global? [config data?](https://vercel.com/blog/edge-config-public-beta)
why does config data get a ticket to the edge but nothing else?
It's unfortunate that we're forced into this tradeoff. Some data lives here because of... well,
that's just how it's done. But this other data it's the "global" stuff, it goes into
_specialized data APIs_.

### We're all information merchants.

Let's face it the overwhelming majority of software we build exists primarily to give users
leverage over information. Think about pretty much any bit of software you've worked on or
an online service you use and ask yourself, at a high level, what does it do?
why am I using it? or why do people use it? Do your answers match any of the following.

- presenting information
- providing leverage over information
- searching/locating/finding bits of information
- running calculations on information
- recording new information
- enforcing constraints on new information (coordination)

Google, Twitter, News Sites, Excel Spreadsheets, Text Editors, Gmail, Facebook, Netflix, Git and
Github they're all information merchants! Even e-commerce companies like amazon or services like
Uber/AirBnB have significant information components. Would any of these applications work at all
you took away the information they manage?

You might not be building the next Twitter but information handling is just as
vital in internal business apps and enterprise software. It might seem obvious, we work in
"information technology" after all, but It's funny we seem to spend very little time talking about
information compared to our code constructs and tooling.

### Information... What is it?

What is this stuff? Let's start with **data**. We've all got some understanding of what data is.
I like to think of it as any old collection of values.

- including but not limited to any combination of strings, numbers, booleans,
  raw bytes, dates, arrays, maps, sets.
- you could think of data in it's encoded format like JSON or CSV.
- there's no required structure or shape to data.

As an example here's some data: `["michael", 21]` a string and a number.
Does that data convey any information? I'd argue no, not anything useful. At best you could
say it's partial or incomplete information.

What about `["michael", 21, "years_old"]`? Michael is 21 years old. Is that a complete piece
of information? Is it useful? If I gave it to someone else could they use it? Not really,
because we don't know when Michael was 21 years old.

`["michael", 21, "years_old", "2012-01-01"]`. Okay now we've got a concrete piece of information.
There's a lot to say about it compared to the first two examples.

- It's useful.
  - I can figure out a time frame when michael was born!
  - Or roughly how many years old michael is at any other time.
  - I can compare it to other information. Is michael older than me?
- It's complete. I don't need something else to use it.
  - Sure I might need **other** information to understand more but
    this piece of information by itself is enough to be useful.
- I can remember it.
- I can simply share it to convey the information.
- Others can remember it and see the same thing. It's the same information.
- Others could reproduce the same result from it.
- Sharing does not involve coordination or locking, just send it.
- It **can not change**. If it could change, what exactly are you conveying?
- I can cache it indefinitely. If you're struggling with cache invalidation you're
  **not** dealing with information! (at least how it's defined here)
- A piece of information can be modelled with as little as 4 values.
  - entity. the thing being observed
  - a named property or attribute being observed.
  - the magnitude/quantity of the named property
  - a time of the observation
- All information is data. But data is not always information.
- Information has nothing to do with truth or veracity that's a higher level concept.
  - It's okay to decide information is wrong or bad at a latter time or to add better information.
- A piece of information can be about the future (a prediction).
- Transactions are a mechanism for ingesting & creating information so that certain constraints
  and system guarantees are met.
  - Once the transaction is finished the result is (or should be) just information with the same
    characteristics listed above.
